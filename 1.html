  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation"

  <p>Animation is more pervasive than many people realise. Apart from short films, feature films, animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also heavily used for video games, motion graphics and special effects. Animation is also prevalent in information technology interfaces.</p>
